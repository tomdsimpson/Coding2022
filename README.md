# Gold DofE Skills Section 

For my Gold section I wanted to build of the game development I started looking at towards the end of silver and try a few things that caught my interest. This included: Tetris, Wordle and solver, neural networks and a simple scrolling game.

## Chat Server

This project consists of 2 programs, a server which manages connections and the exchange of information and a client program which sends and recieves data from the server. The socket module and server IP to allow comunication and the threading module to run tasks simultaneously.

First you run the server program, then run the client inputting a username and the IP of the server (0.0.0.0 if its the local machine). Then the chat window will open allowing you to connect, disconnect and send messages.
